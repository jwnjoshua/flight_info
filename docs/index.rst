**flight_info** is a Python library that wraps around the Aviation Edge and FlightLabs APIs. This package contains two main functions to help 
users observe historical flight schedules and find average delays over the last 14 days for any flight. Two other functions are included to help 
users find the relevant IATA airport and airline codes to assist them in their search.

This package requires valid API keys from Aviation Edge and FlightLabs, both of which require paid fees start from $5 adn $2.50 for 30k and 1k calls respectively per month. 
See https://aviation-edge.com/developers/ and https://app.goflightlabs.com/dashboard for more information. 

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
